<h2>About</h2>
<p>After completing my undergraduate education, I started my master's degree education to specialize 
    more in my department. I learned to be much more self-disciplined and self-sacrificing during the my 
    master degree process, especially during the writing thesis process. Within the scope of my thesis 
    study, I prepared the landslide susceptibility maps of the Yalova-Çınarcık region with different 
    methods and we published this study as a paper with my thesis advisor. While continuing master study, 
    I also had an active business life. In that job, I was working in the energy sector and it was my first 
    job in the energy sector. Now I decided to change my profession. </p>
